# EDGE-ESPS Project - Buzzer Control and Data Monitoring System

## Overview
This project addresses the following issues:

1. **Buzzer Problem:** The buzzer was sounding at times when it shouldn't. To solve this problem, we adjusted an `if` statement for each buzzer block (both on and off).

2. **Data Monitoring:** We faced the challenge of collecting the last five DHT results and calculating their average. To solve this, we used `for` loops and managed to store and process the data every 5 seconds.
